        <p>
          Trained classically as a musician, I have experiences in designing audio effects and music for various projects. The Golden Ticket, being the most recent one, is a 2D simulator my teammate and I are working on currently. I help with designing its audio by the use of Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) and various synthesizers.
          <br /><br />
          One key aspects of sound engineering is how the outcome interacts with the narrative and how it represents the story. To me, the synergy is the most important principle about creating sound/audios.
          <br /><br />
          Besides that, I've also helped with sound design when it comes to micro movies. The selection of background music, the effects, and the voiceover are key to assist the visual storytelling.

          <p>
            I have also engaged in songwriting and production, including (re)arranging songs, recording, and mixing them. Genres include pop, rock, jazz, classical music, but I am more than willing to explore different sounds.
            <br /><br />
            <h4>The Golden Ticket Soundtrack</h4>
            The Golden Ticket is a video game developed by me and my friend Joe. It is a 2D simulator adapted from the book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. I composed and produced the soundtrack for the game.
            <br /><br />
            Each track is designed to reflect the <i>sanity</i> (health/mental state) of the character, Charlie, as he figures out the way to get the Golden Ticket. The music transitions from light-hearted and playful melodies to darker, more psychedelic tones as Charlie's sanity decreases, enhancing the immersive experience of the game.
            <br /><br />
            You can listen to the soundtrack here:

            <h4>Planets that Revolve around the Ruby Moon</h4>
            <i>Planets that Revolve around the Ruby Moon</i> is a short story collection of four imaginatary planets. Each planet has its own unique characteristics and its soundtrack (composed and produced by me). This multimedia project combines written narratives with audio elements (as well as a pixel art I drew) to create an immersive and fun experience for readers.
