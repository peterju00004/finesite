          The Design an Inclusive Spaceship Collaborative Operation (DISCO) is an Open Educational Resource toolkit that uses a playful spaceship–building metaphor to teach inclusive design principles. As User Testing Coordinator and Research Assistant, I managed outreach to disability organizations, recruited and scheduled participants, and facilitated both remote and in-person co-design sessions. Over twelve weeks, we synthesized the user feedback into actionable design recommendations, and hosted a final playtesting workshop. Through this work, DISCO provides educators and designers with a fun, hands-on way to promote accessibility awareness and real-world inclusive design strategies.
