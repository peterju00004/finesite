            <p>
                The Ruby Moon sits at the center of the four fascinating planets. It has several hundred craters, though nobody has ever counted them. The scientists who first discovered it simply looked at its surface and said, <i>“There must be several hundred craters on it.”</i> And so, everyone believes that must be true. Counting them one by one would take far too much time.
                <br /><br />
                The craters glow faintly under the neon haze, each rim catching the red light differently, so from afar the surface seems to pulse, as if the Moon were breathing. The gas cloud that gives the Ruby Moon its color drifts slowly, wrapping and unwrapping it like a veil. Every few years, the glow deepens, and astronomers argue over whether the Moon is dimming or waking up.
                <br /><br />
                Nobody’s ever landed on it, of course. The orbit is too unstable, and the radiation from the gas strong enough to melt most probes. Yet every transmission sent too close to the surface returns a whisper of static that sounds almost like speech. Some say the craters are mouths, and the Moon murmuring to its planets. Others say it’s just the echo of our curiosity bouncing back at us.
                <br /><br />
                Or maybe it’s simply the noise of the spacecraft engines. Who knows! Anyway, the neon atmosphere is a spectacular tourist attraction. Many pay for a seat on a rocket to orbit the Red Moon. They like to keep a safe distance, though, as the power of the radiation could easily demolish a fragile human vessel, or blind a human eye. That’s why inhabitants of the neighboring planets always wear sunglasses, even when they sleep. There are benefits to the light, though: it illuminates the nearby worlds, adding a surreal yet natural layer to everything we see.
                <br /><br />
                At night (if you can call it “night” in a place where the sky glows red), the light from the Moon turns everything into silhouette and shadow. The oceans on nearby planets shimmer like liquid glass, and trees reflect the crimson palette as if painted with dust. Artists from the Christmas Planet say their entire color theory was born from this light source. They call it <i>the glow that makes shadows blush.</i>
                <br /><br />
                Orbiting stations sell souvenirs: bottled “Ruby Moon glow,” which is really just tinted neon gas sealed in glass bulbs. Tourists keep them as charms, believing they bring luck or courage. Scientists scoff at it (of course). But many of them still tend to keep one on their desks at their workplaces.

            <p>
                Perilune gets its name from the word <i>periapsis</i>, which in astronomical terms is the closest point in an orbit. Nobody calls it that, though. In fact, if you do, people will laugh and mock your ignorance. <i>“Perilune! Haha! What a stupid name!”</i> That’s what you’ll hear, or something close to it. Instead, everyone calls it the Planet with a Worrying Orbit because, as the name suggests, its orbit is worrying indeed. It’s nearly caused catastrophic disasters several times. Or maybe it already has – who knows?
                <br /><br />
                The orbit of Perilune isn’t a circle or even an ellipse; it’s a child’s scribble, looping and tilting in ways that make physicists shake their heads. Every few decades, its trajectory brings it dangerously close to another planet, and astronomers hold their breath. They publish anxious predictions, draw elaborate charts, and try to convince the public that everything is under control. Then, when disaster somehow doesn’t strike, they quietly erase their models and start again.
                <br /><br />
                Residents on nearby planets claim they can feel Perilune’s approach before any instruments detect it. “The air feels different,” they say. “Our shadows curve the wrong way.” On the Christmas Planet, it’s become tradition to ring bells whenever the red light in the sky begins to wobble; they believe it’s a ritual to “steady the orbit.” No one can agree whether it works or if it’s just another telling of the placebo effect.
                <br /><br />
                Sometimes, Perilune strays like a vagabond, drifting so far that astronomers guarantee it’s gone for good and destined to crash into some distant, unlucky world. But somehow, it always returns to the Ruby Moon, like a boomerang finding its thrower. No theory can explain this. The science just isn’t there yet. But people love this planet anyway, even though it’s made them scream and shout a million times.
                <br /><br />
                Some say the Ruby Moon itself keeps Perilune tethered by longing. The two have been circling each other for as long as records exist, and perhaps the Moon simply refuses to let go. Others claim Perilune is alive, stubborn as a creature that refuses to obey the laws written for everything else. “It just doesn’t like straight lines,” one old astronomer once said, right before him retiring early.
                <br /><br />
                Despite the risk, Perilune is a favorite destination for daredevil explorers. Its irregular orbit makes each visit unpredictable: sometimes a short leap, sometimes a near-impossible chase. They say if you land there and stay long enough, the ground shivers beneath your feet, and you can feel the energy of its strange motion, as if the planet itself remembers the path it’s supposed to follow but chooses not to.

            <iframe width="100%" height="300" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/soundcloud%253Atracks%253A2216590355&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe><div style={{fontSize: '10px', color: '#cccccc', lineBreak: 'anywhere', wordBreak: 'normal', overflow: 'hidden', whiteSpace: 'nowrap', textOverflow: 'ellipsis', fontFamily: 'Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif', fontWeight: 100}}><a href="https://soundcloud.com/peterju00004" title="Peter Ju" target="_blank" style={{color: '#cccccc', textDecoration: 'none'}}>Peter Ju</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/peterju00004/planet-that-does-not-exist-3" title="Planet that Does Not Exist" target="_blank" style={{color: '#cccccc', textDecoration: 'none'}}>Planet that Does Not Exist</a></div>
            <p>
                This planet does not exist. You hear me? It’s not a planet. How can you call something that doesn’t exist a planet? It could be anything: a rock, a flower, a song. But why a planet? The story ends now. Thanks for listening.
                <br /><br />
                Except the story doesn’t really end, because every time someone says, “It doesn’t exist,” the planet seems to grow a little more real. People start drawing it, first as a joke, then with more conviction. Some say they’ve seen its faint outline through telescopes, a blur between stars that shifts whenever you try to focus. A few scientists argue that the data suggests <i>something</i> is there, though no two measurements ever agree on where “there” is.
                <br /><br />
                The inhabitants of other planets treat it like a rumor that refuses to fade. On the Christmas Planet, they leave a gift each year “for the planet that does not exist,” just in case. Children look up at the Ruby Moon and whisper, “Are you hiding it?” And when communications satellites pick up static from deep space, they label it in their logs: <i>possible transmission from non-existent source.</i>
                <br /><br />
                But nobody has ever actually witnessed its beauty. Some scientific research suggests it might have crashed with the Planet with a Worrying Orbit long ago, shattering the Planet that Does Not Exist (but Had Existed) into pieces of rock and piles of sand. Others reject this theory, calling it “hate speech toward the Planet with a Worrying Orbit.” But everyone knows that’s just another joke. Spreading scandals or misinformation about that beloved planet is strictly prohibited, because everyone loves it too much.
                <br /><br />
                And so, the Planet that Does Not Exist remains the most discussed, most depicted, and most studied object in the system, precisely because it isn’t there. Whole academic departments are devoted to proving its absence, publishing data that never agrees with itself. Artists ignore all of that. They paint it in colors no telescope could ever capture, imagining mountain ranges, oceans, even weather patterns of rains and shines.
                <br /><br />
                Once a year, a small group of enthusiasts holds a vigil, pointing their telescopes at the coordinates where the planet should be if it were real. They sit together in silence, waiting for nothing to happen. And when nothing does, they smile. It is the exact proof that the universe still contains mysteries that refuse to be found.

            <p>
                The Christmas Planet is the only habitable world among the four. People have lived there for as long as anyone remembers (probably from an early planetary expedition) though nobody recalls which exact one. On the Christmas Planet, people celebrate Christmas every day. It’s a ritual everyone follows, no questions asked. When you see people enjoying themselves so completely, you can’t help but jive in.
                <br /><br />
                Each day begins with the ringing of bells instead of alarms, but clear silver tones that echo through the streets. Shops open with garlands already in place, snow machines hum quietly even in summer, and there’s always the faint scent of cinnamon and other baked spices in the air. Children unwrap presents that seem to replace themselves overnight. The same carols and jingles play on endless loops, and no one ever grows tired of them. It is, everyone agrees, the happiest planet in the system.
                <br /><br />
                Still, some visitors notice things the locals don’t (or, never) mention. The sky always stays at a faint blush of dawn. The clocks all read slightly different times, as if the hours themselves are in celebration. And sometimes, very late at night, when the bells stop for a brief moment, the silence feels so wide and deep that it almost swallows the lights.
                <br /><br />
                This is unusual, especially when the Christmas Planet is so close to the Ruby Moon. People always wear sunglasses to protect their eyes from the neon glare. Every day repeats the last, but nobody is tired of the celebrations. For the locals, celebrating Christmas every day is a way to cherish their relationships and the feeling of connection, and to breathe in the cheerful, sensual rejoicing that floats in the air.
                <br /><br />
                Visitors sometimes ask what happens when the gifts run out, or when the music begins to lose its charm: there must be an end to this. The locals just laugh, though not mockingly, with genuine warmth, as though the question itself misses the point, like those asked by a toddler to an adult. “There is always another present,” they say. “You just haven’t opened it yet.” Indeed: each morning, new ribbons appear, new tunes sing through the air, and no one can remember where they came from.
                <br /><br />
                Some historians believe that the first settlers might have programmed the celebrations into the planet’s systems long ago, to keep morale high during the harsh early years. If that’s true, the mechanism has long outlived its creators. Yet perhaps that doesn’t matter. The joy feels real enough. And in a world lit by the red glow of a restless moon, maybe endless Christmas is its own form of coping mechanism.
